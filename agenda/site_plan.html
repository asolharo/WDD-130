      <p>I have been called as a ward executive secretary and one of the first things i did was to look for an efficient way
        to keep the bishopric members and myself sync with the agenda of interviews that they need to do.
        <br><br>
        There are several tools to manage information and responsabilities but I could not find an easy way for them to see
        their schedules any time of the day. The official calendar have a lot of events already and the interviews can be
        lost through them. I know I could text them individually or through different applications. We can have the list of
        interviews that needs to be done on the Church's website but there is no way to register appointments or follow up them,
        mark if already done.
        <br><br>
        This website will be a visually clean scheduler where the bishop and his counselors can check their next appointments,
        the names and reasons of each person they will meet and a tool for the secretaries to make the schedule and follow up
        those appointments by marking the ones done and the ones that need to be rescheduled.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The Bishop and his two counselors form a ward of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,
          as well as the executive secretary of that ward that look for an efficient and simple way to keep them
          all in the same page of what interviews have been scheduled, time and date, who's going to be the interviewer and what's the reason.
          a Bishopric that wants to be informed so they can have a better management of their time.
