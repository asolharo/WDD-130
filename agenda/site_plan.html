      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>I have been called as a ward executive secretary and one of the first things i did was to look for an efficient way
        to keep the bishopric members and myself sync with the agenda of interviews that they need to do.
        <br><br>
        There are several tools to manage information and responsabilities but I could not find an easy way for them to see
        their schedules any time of the day. The official calendar have a lot of events already and the interviews can be
        lost through them. I know I could text them individually or through different applications. We can have the list of
        interviews that needs to be done on the Church's website but there is no way to register appointments or follow up them,
        mark if already done.
        <br><br>
        This website will be a visually clean scheduler where the bishop and his counselors can check their next appointments,
        the names and reasons of each person they will meet and a tool for the secretaries to make the schedule and follow up
        those appointments by marking the ones done and the ones that need to be rescheduled.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The Bishop and his two counselors form a ward of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,
          as well as the executive secretary of that ward that look for an efficient and simple way to keep them
          all in the same page of what interviews have been scheduled, time and date, who's going to be the interviewer and what's the reason.
          a Bishopric that wants to be informed so they can have a better management of their time.

      <h3>Guidelines</h3>
      <p>Those who visit this site will have help in <strong>optimizing their time and effectively scheduling interviews</strong> with their church leaders.</p>
      <p>In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the bishop and his two counselors have the <strong>power and responsibility</strong> to handle administrative and personal matters with the members of their ward. There are approximately 200 active members in Bonista Vista ward who require periodic interviews with the bishopric. In order to cover this need, this page will provide the resources to schedule an electronic appointment with a leader in an easy, effective and fast way. It allows the user to move or cancel their appointment in a simple way. The ward executive secretary will monitor any changes and notify the member of the bishopric.</p>
      <p>Also on this site you can <strong>consult guidelines </strong>about interviews. The General Handbook establish this on section 31:</p>
      <p><strong>Purposes of Interviews</strong><br>
      In general, Church leaders interview members to determine whether they:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Are prepared to receive or participate in an ordinance.</li>
      <li>Should be called to a position in the Church.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most interviews of this kind are conducted by a member of the bishopric or stake presidency. They cannot be delegated to other ward leaders.</p>
      <p>There are some ward members who are unaware that they should schedule their regular temple recommend appointment. In the same way, there are other types of recommendations that extend, for example, to weddings, missionary service, seminary and institute graduation.</p>
      <p>Youth must be interviewed each birthday by a member of the bishopric.</p>
      <p>There are issues of personal dignity that must be addressed by appointment and with a scheduled time.</p>

      <p>In the interview, the bishopric member ensures that the child understands the purposes of baptism (see 2 Nephi 31:5- 20).<br>
        He also ensures that the child under- stands the baptismal covenant and is committed to live by it (see Mosiah 18:8-10).<br>
        He does not need to use a specified list of questions. This is not an interview to determine worthiness, since "little children need no repentance" (Moroni 8:11).</p>
      <p>Permission of parents or guardians is required before a minor can be baptized (see 38.2.8.2).</p>
