              <h4>Purposes of Interviews</h4><br>
              In general, Church leaders interview members to determine whether they:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Are prepared to receive or participate in an ordinance.</li>
              <li>Should be called to a position in the Church.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Most interviews of this kind are conducted by a member of the bishopric or stake presidency. They cannot be delegated to other ward leaders.</p>
              <p>There are some ward members who are unaware that they should schedule their regular temple recommend appointment. In the same way, there are other types of recommendations that extend, for example, to weddings, missionary service, seminary and institute graduation.</p>
              <p>Youth must be interviewed each birthday by a member of the bishopric.</p>
              <p style="color:#3A53A4 ;">There are issues of personal dignity that must be addressed by appointment and with a scheduled time.</p>

            <p>In the interview, the bishopric member ensures that the child understands the purposes of baptism (see 2 Nephi 31:5- 20).<br>
              He also ensures that the child under- stands the baptismal covenant and is committed to live by it (see Mosiah 18:8-10).<br>
              He does not need to use a specified list of questions. This is not an interview to determine worthiness, since "little children need no repentance" (Moroni 8:11).</p>
            <p>Permission of parents or guardians is required before a minor can be baptized (see 38.2.8.2).</p>
